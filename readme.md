# Friend Finder

This is an express app that is deployed thru heroku. 
The app sorts an array of possible friends and present a user a potential "friend" based on survey questions. 

Much of the excercise was routing and setting up an express server.

## Further Enhancement
This project is a bit of a stepping stone to more fully flushed out and interactive server deployments. Much can be inporved and extended, which we are moving forward already!
